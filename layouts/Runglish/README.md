# Runglish layout

US - RU direct binding layout.

Why?

Changing main layout make adapting process harder X2.\
Also default russian layout uses symbol keys as characters which very annoying sometimes.\
So decision is pretty simple: rebind to main layout similar keys and keys which not fit goes to AltGr layer.

Some highlights:

| Key | Map | AltGr |
|-----|-----|-------|
|  Q  |  Ы  |   Э   |
|  W  |  Ь  |   Ъ   |
|  Y  |  Й  |       |
|  U  |  У  |   Ю   |
|  F  |  Я  |   Ф   |
|  H  |  Х  |       |
|  X  |  Ш  |   Щ   |
|  C  |  Ч  |   Ц   |


Note: on qwerty layout it might looks strange, but in my case with full custom main layout it lays almost perfectly.
